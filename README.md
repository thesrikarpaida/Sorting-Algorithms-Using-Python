# Sorting-Algorithms-In-Python

This repository contains implementation of some of the common sorting algorithms in Python programming language.
 - Bubble Sort
 - Selection Sort
 - Insertion Sort
 - Merge Sort
 - Quick Sort

These sorting algorithms have different time complexities and space complexities.

| **Algorithm**      | **Time Complexity**  | **Space Complexity** |
| :----------------: |:--------------------:| :-------------------:|
| Bubble Sort        | O(n^2)               | O(1)                 |
| Selection Sort     | O(n^2)               | O(1)                 |
| Insertion Sort     | O(n^2)               | O(1)                 |
| Merge Sort         | O(n \* log(n))       | O(n)                 |
| Quick Sort         | O(n \* log(n))       | O(log(n))            |
